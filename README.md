# WebdriverIO Test Script with API Integration

This Node.js script automates web testing using WebdriverIO and integrates API calls using `node-fetch`. It demonstrates navigating a web page, performing actions based on assertions, and reporting test outcomes via API calls.

## Features

- Automates browser actions and assertions with WebdriverIO.
- Makes POST API calls to report test results.
- Loads environment variables for configuration.
- Configurable wait times for assertions.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later recommended for full ESM support)
- An API key for authentication with your API service
- WebdriverIO and other dependencies installed

## Setup

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the script to your local machine.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required npm packages.
   ```sh
   npm install webdriverio node-fetch dotenv wdio-wait-for expect-webdriverio
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API key.
   ```
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Script Explanation

- **API Calls**: The script includes functions `makeAPICall`, `Passed`, and `Failed` for making POST requests to report the test outcomes.
- **Browser Automation**: Uses WebdriverIO to automate browser interactions for testing web page elements.
- **Environment Variables**: Utilizes `dotenv` for loading configuration like API keys securely.
- **Assertions and Wait Times**: Configures global wait times and performs assertions to validate test steps.

## Running the Script

To run the script, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
node example_test_js.mjs
```

Ensure you are in the directory where the script is located. The script logs its progress and the outcomes of the API calls.

## Reporting Test Outcomes

The script automatically reports the test outcome using the `Passed` or `Failed` function based on the execution flow. Successful completion of all test steps triggers a call to `Passed`, otherwise `Failed` is called.

## Additional Information

- Customize the API endpoint and headers within the `makeAPICall` function as needed.
- Test steps can be modified or extended within the async function that encapsulates the WebdriverIO logic.

For more details on WebdriverIO, refer to the [official documentation](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted).
